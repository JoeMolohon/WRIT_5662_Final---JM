<h2>WRIT 5662 - Writing with Digital Technologies (Fall 2019)</h2>

<p>Throughout this course, we have examined the role of technology in our lives. Questions for class discussion have included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What counts as writing in the age of Web 2.0?</li>
	<li>What does a multimodal experience look like?</li>
	<li>How do we create quality content for Web 2.0?</li>
	<li>How do we create dynamic web content?</li>
	<li>What are the merits of HTML and XML?</li>
	<li>How do we use coding languages for structuring, developing, managing, and publishing content?</li>
	<li>What is the impact of multimodality on interactivity and use?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our readings have encouraged us to examine themes of the ubiquity of technology and its influence upon our lives. Through assignments, we have learned to apply these themes in principle. Of particular note has been the <b>client website</b> we worked on throughout this course, contributing new content to our prototype as we learned and interacted with our client to meet their legitimate business needs.</p>

<p>An expanded familiarity with coding languages is a major skill we students have gained from this course, but it is hardly the only resource. If there is one thing beyond content creation that knowledge of a coding language is good for, it is becoming a better digital citizen. Knowledge of coding expands one's digital literacy greatly, allowing one to see the inner workings of the web pages one interacts with daily. When coupled with real-world experience and training in the theory behind digital modes of presentation, one is able to merge coding knowledge with the specific skills and subsets that make up their professional identity. One is able to use the internet and its modes for their own purposes.</p>

<p>This website is an example of what I have learned from this course. It is increased my flexibility as a technical writer (a skill I find to be very important) and it has enabled me to deliver content like this to you in this format. Flexibility is a theme that has been very important to me in my technical writing journey; I hope to capture some of that here. You'll multiple modes of information delivery within this website, even some that may direct you outside it. I encourage you to explore each of these avenues as you encounter them. Furthermore, as you explore, I encourage you to reflect upon how important technology is to our lives today--how ever-present it is and how society and technology grow to accommodate each other.</p> 

<p>I'll let you dig and discover most of the website on your own, but here's a hint: try clicking on the link below. It leads to a companion document I wrote for this website. If you're interested in the theory behind what I have made here, you will find much more of that there.</p>
