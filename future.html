<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>I think my research interests, my future classes, and my present challenges and objectives at work should keep me busy for the future. These three things will drive my development as a technical writer. Of this, I am certain, even as I cannot be sure how they will change me specifically.</p>

<p>Five years from now, I would like to have created an effective CMS for 3M Fall Protection. I would like to still have an important in the company's document creation process. I would like to have obtained my M.S. in Technical Communication from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. But even then I must be honest that plans can change. My wife is a Marine now, after all--she graduates from boot camp this coming Friday, December 13. As a military spouse, I am likely to have to leave Minnesota, at least for a while.</p>

<p>Like my own future, the future of technology is determinable in only a general sense. There are broad areas of specialization and development that society is all but guaranteed to expand into, but we cannot say specifically how these areas shall develop.</p>

<h3>The Internet of Things</h3>
<p>More and more devices today feature internet connectivity, from watches to home devices like Amazon's Alexa to Google Assistant. In the future, we are likely to have entire 'smart' homes, living spaces where each function of the house is controllable via an online or mobile app. The prevalence of this connectivity will likely extend beyond the home to all sorts of non-digital objects we use today.</p>

<h3>Personalization of Content</h3>
<p>Reusable, customizable content is a by-product of topic-based, single-source methods of content management. As the latter gains a stronger foothold, so too will personalized, customizable modes of delivery to the customer.</p>

<h3>Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality</h3>
<p>VR and AR have many possibilities for changing the business world. Instruction manuals would be able to include 3D models for greater comprehension of the subject and potential customers could visit business sites through a VR headset, without ever having to leave their home office. Like Internet-connected devices, VR and AR have a wide range of flexibility for use and change.</p>

<p>These are the areas that I believe to be most important to the future of information on the Web. These are areas that I believe all businesses will have to consider in the future, just as most businesses today have to consider how to accommodate mobile users with their product and website. The presence of technology in our lives isn't slowing down or coming to a plateau; if anything, its presence is only expanding at an ever more rapid rate. There are revolutionary technologies beyond those I have noted here that are all being developed at the same time... Technologies like renewable energy, gene editing, nanotech, and bionics are all examples of tech that could create a future vastly different from the present reality of 2019. Whatever happens, society will have to adapt with its inventions. And as society seeks to adapt, it will need technical writers to help them do so.</p>

<p>And that is exactly where I want to be.</p>
