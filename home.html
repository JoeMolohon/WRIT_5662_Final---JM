<h1>Digital Scholarship Portfolio</h1>
<h2>"At this point in time..."</h2>

<p>This website is a part of WRIT 5662, a course in my graduate-level program at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. It has been three months since the start of this course, and many assignments and milestones since that first discussion post. This website is my final. It might even be my last website for a while.</p>
<p>For those of you wondering what I did for the past three months, this website is a reminder. For myself, it is a reflection; a sense of perspective; a means of shaping the pathway forward. I have learned much since the beginning. What beginning? Well, a few, I would say. Since the beginning of this course. Since the beginning of my technical writing journey. Since my beginning as a writer. Since the first time I ever put my hands on a keyboard, way, way back when I was a child.</p>
<p>Our lives are bound up in change, and as time passes, we can't help but grow. And as we all grow together as a society, our technology grows with us. It shapes our growth, it is our growth, it becomes our growth. We live in a world now where less and less of the world without tech remains. Gone is the generation that remembers life without cars. Going are those that remember life without TV, without electricity. Coming down the pipe now are those that will not know a world without internet--without cell phones, without computers, without the ability to take a plane to every major city in the country. Society is a network of change and technology lies at the center of it.</p>
<p>As part of this change, the new generation has discovered a language unknown to its forebearers--digital literacy. We've picked up on the fact that one advancement in tech leads to another. The wheel makes the wagon makes the car makes the motorcycle; it's all interconnected. Centralization is also the new mode of the Web. We can learn one aspect of it and set the building blocks for picking up many others. What I learned about Microsoft Word in seventh grade, in a sense, set the stage for my work as a technical writer today.</p>
<p>How do we convey information today? How does this information relate to who we are today? These are the themes I mean to explore with this work, both on a more personal, individual note and as a means of saying something about our world today. Everything is interconnected and I am no different. We are all pieces in something larger.</p>
