<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>My current research interests owe a lot to my present background. From my prior and present experiences as a working technical writer, I have gained an appreciation for some of the real-world problems our profession encounters. For the long term, I am interesting in interacting with and working towards the solution of those problems.</p> 

<p>I would say that there are a few major themes I would like to focus on. The first among them would be symbolic interaction. I want to understand more as to how societies codify information and how different cultures tend to perceive arrangements of symbols. A good part of this interest of mine comes from my background as a creative writer, an identity that is always interested in how I might best get my vision across to my reader, but it would be erroneous to assume technical writers are not influenced by the same desire. At 3M, I am constantly looking for ways to present in a more efficient, effective, and user-friendly manner. It's an especially important objective with such complex manuals as the ones I write there. Codifying information both saves space and saves readers a lot of time and effort. As it goes, readers aren't particularly excited by large, long portions of text. I would love to be able to explore alternatives further.</p>

<p>The second theme I would like to focus on is the evolution of coding languages, in particular ones like DITA and XML. This course and my work at 3M have especially ignited my interest in this subject. I am part of a team creating a DITA-based CMS for 3M. We're at the document analysis stage currently, but even at this stage I can say that 3M is encountering problems the current DITA system does not cover easily. Although the content I work with has the ability to be standardized and made reusable--and already is, to a great extent--transitioning the huge, complex body of content of our IFUs into a markup format is not an easy task. For one, DITA does not easily render complex arrangements of images. For another, it isn't great with tables either. Both of these components are especially important for our manuals. Beyond these specific issues we're encountering, I would also argue that DITA loses its effectiveness as content becomes larger and more complex. If this belief of mine is true, then it is a fundamental failure of the markup language--our situation is exactly the kind of situation markup languages should have been designed for in the first place. I don't know that I will be the one to discover the solution, but I would certainly like to do more research on this subject.</p>

<p>The final subject I might like to research is the integration of virtual reality and augmented reality in documentation. I honestly believe that VR and AR are the future of documentation. There are so many new opportunities for information distribution that these mediums open up, especially for my current industry. With the implementation of VR, customers could see 3D models of product before purchase and during installation of said product, or even take a virtual tour of the production facility without ever leaving their own office of business. I am particularly interested in learning more about what opportunities VR and AR afford technical documentation.</p>
