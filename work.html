<h2>My Work</h2>

<p>I began working as a technical writer before I enrolled in this program. I was fresh out of college and working on my own news startup when I discovered Code for Social Good. They were a small website and they were looking for volunteers to help them grow. One position they were looking to fill was for a technical writer--someone to provide them with website documentation and help them create content with the end user in mind. I wasn't trained as a technical writer, but I was trained as a journalist and as a writer who was technologically capable. Since I was taking a Lynda course about technical writing, I decided to join them.</p> 

<p>Since then, my journey has been something of a whirlwind.</p>

<p>That spring, I got my first paid job as a technical writer with Sitesafe. That summer, I enrolled in the University of Minnesota's graduate certificate program for Scientific and Technical Communication. That fall, I applied for a job at 3M as a technical writer and was accepted. I am a little over a year into that job now and I have been given several opportunities...</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating instructions for use (IFUs) for engineer-designed fall protection equipment</li>
<li>Working with translators and translation companies for targeted translation of IFUs</li>
<li>Facilitating document template changes and updates</li>
<li>Designing new document templates</li>
<li>Managing a document repository for storage and printing</li>
<li>Working with in-house printers and marketers to produce documents</li>
<li>Leading inter-departmental efficiency initiatives</li>
</ul>
<p>... as well as a few new challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing a DITA-based Content Management System (CMS) that works for huge, highly-technical documents</li>
<li>Assisting other global regions in developing more efficient, customizable document creation and translation channels</li>
<li>Updating the indexing and printing systems to better facilitate business initiatives</li>
<li>Bringing legacy content into a more user-friendly, digital-friendly format</li>
</ul>

<p><i>By scanning the Zappar code above, you can see some examples of my work at 3M. To scan a Zappar code, it is necessary to first install the "Zappar" app. You should be able to find this on your smart phone's app store for free.</i></p>
<p>Of course, I find that the line between "challenge" and "opportunity" is a fine one. Without my challenges, I would not be the professional I am today. I was promoted to "Advanced Technical Writer" within my company this past October. The promotion is primarily because of all the work I do for 3M. They appreciate the additional responsibilities I have taken on since my hiring, as well as my eagerness to dive into new challenges. Regardless of the change, my own expectations for my work will remain fixed on that higher standard I have always tried to aim for.</p>

<p>For me, the strangest part of this is that, three years ago, I never would have thought I'd be a technical writer. I had a hard time imagining what was going to happen to me, but I was almost sure technical writing wasn't part of it. I thought engineering was soulless and I certainly had no interest in IKEA manuals. Little did I know that my heart would open up to engineering a few years later, and that my own vehemence for IKEA manuals would turn into strongly-held beliefs as to what a good instruction manual should be. I'm still changing. I'm still growing and that's why I'm here. I still feel that I have more to learn and I want to apply that which I learn in my classes to my work at 3M.</p>

<p>In a previous assignment, we, the students of WRIT 5662, were asked to provide a map of our Personal Learning Network (PLN). In a similar mindset, I have created a map of my digital literacy, accessible on the next page. This map is crucial to understanding how I made my way to where I am today, as well as understanding where I might stand next.</p>
